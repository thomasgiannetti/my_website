```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


It happens, although those remain rare one-time events, that my anger gets the best of me when I can't figure out a code. Here is my latest example, while building this website:

```{r picture, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/im10.jpg", error = FALSE)
```

  
(This is a joke, of course, to display my great sense of humour as part of my portfolio.)
