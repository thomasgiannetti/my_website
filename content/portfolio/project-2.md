#### Project Overview

The goal of this project was to map the Covid-19 vaccination levels by county and plot it with the percentage of Trump Vote on the past US elections. This allowed us to perhaps observe a correlation between the two variables. It was also important to take into account there is a large difference in how densily populated each county can be.
