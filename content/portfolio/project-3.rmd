#### Project Overview

The goal of this project was to observe the data from the 2021 Ask A Manager Survey and see what inferences could be made from it. What statistical analysis can be conducted to add value ? 
We chose to look at the potential factors that influenced the salary of a US Manager. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

#loading the dataset
ask_a_manager_2021_cleaned <- read_csv(here::here("data", "ask_a_manager_2021_cleaned.csv"))

#loading the libraries
library(usmap)
library(ggplot2)

#cleaning the dataset to include data only from the US and cleaning the names in the State column
ask_a_manager_states_clean <- ask_a_manager_2021_cleaned %>% 
  filter(country == "United States") %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(state = str_split(state, ",")) %>% 
  mutate(state = as.character(state[1]))

#creating a new dataframe with the mean salaries for each state
usmap_df <- ask_a_manager_states_clean %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(median_salary = median(salary_usd, na.rm = TRUE)) 

#plotting the data with a color code
plot_usmap(regions = "state", data = usmap_df, values = "median_salary") + 
  labs(title = "Median Salary by State in the United States of America",
       subtitle = "Ask a Manager Survey 2021") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "white", 
                        high = "red", 
                        name = "Salary in US $", 
                        label = scales::comma)+
  theme(panel.background=element_blank(), legend.position = "right")

```
